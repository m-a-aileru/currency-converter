# Currency Converter

Just a simple currency converter that can display conversion rates of over 150 different currencies. Cryptocurrencies will also be added soon.

## Installation

It is currently an online web app, so no installation needed. Just go to (https://tinyurl.com/currency-convert) and convert some currency.

## Usage

Select a currency of your choice from the dropdown menu in the navy blue section of the app, then enter a valid value in the input box below labelled 'from'. Then select a currency to convert to from the dropdown menu in the lighter blue section of the app, then click the 'Convert' button. The input box on the lighter blue portion of the site will now display the resulting conversion rate from the two selected currencies and value.

## Roadmap

As of 26/07/21:

- Figure out how to space out dropdown options, especially on Edge
- Expanded cross-browser testing (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc), both desktop and mobile
and take note of/fix any browser-related issues
- Addition of some transitions/animations to make it more visually appealing
- Automatic expansion of conversion rate input bar as the value takes up more space
- Pop-up/modal messages for empty/void input values
- More interesting re-design
- Implement function where the conversion rate output is displayed as soon as the focus is taken off the 
conversion rate input bar or as soon as the input value is changed, so there's almost no need for a 'Convert'
button
- Implement "currency swap" feature (make the conversion rates able to swap places and convert accurately)
- Enable limited cryptocurrency conversion
- Addition of necessary accessibility features
