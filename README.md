# currency-converter
Just a simple currency converter that can display conversion rates of over 150 different currencies. Cryptocurrencies will also be added soon.

[TODOs (as of 26/07/21)]

- Figure out how to space out dropdown options, especially on Edge
- Expanded cross-browser testing (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc), both desktop and mobile
and take note of/fix any browser-related issues
- Addition of some transitions/animations to make it more visually appealing
- Automatic expansion of conversion rate input bar as the value takes up more space
- Pop-up/modal messages for empty/void input values
- More interesting re-design
- Implement function where the conversion rate output is displayed as soon as the focus is taken off the 
conversion rate input bar or as soon as the input value is changed, so there's almost no need for a 'Convert'
button
- Implement "currency swap" feature (make the conversion rates able to swap places and convert accurately)
- Enable limited cryptocurrency conversion
- Addition of necessary accessibility features
